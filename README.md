# Focusworks AI

Are you feeling overwhelmed by the amount of activity on Microsoft Teams? Too many messages and documents to keep track of? Don't worry, we've got you covered.

Focusworks AI can help you filter out the unnecessary information and focus on what's important. Our AI can summarize your Teams messages, highlighting the most important information for you. It can also summarize documents that are uploaded to the chatbot.

With our summaries, you can easily stay informed and on top of your work. Plus, you can share the summaries with your colleagues by posting them to Teams channels and group chats.

And to make it even easier, you can view all of your recently created summaries on your dashboard and quickly jump to the original Teams messages. With Focusworks AI, you can consume information efficiently and stay on top of your work. Say goodbye to information overload and hello to a more organized and productive workflow.
